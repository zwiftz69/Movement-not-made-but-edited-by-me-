This is a Rigid body movement for Unity 3d that includes double jumping, crouch, sprinting, and walking in general. it does not have wall run or crouching, 
which I hope to make in the near future. The base movement is made by RYTECH. Go subscribe to his channel at https://www.youtube.com/c/RytechWasTaken

The video that he made to this code is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1uoLBp2I1w&t=660s
